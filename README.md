 ApplePicker, Mission Demolition and Prototype 1

 Prototype 1:
 My prototype is a simple platformer game that takes place in a laboratory. The objective of the game is to successfully collect all thirty of the pickups without getting hit by any of the blocks being dropped by the machines. The pickups are placed all around the laboratory, so the player must traverse the entire space and jump onto the platforms in order to collect them all. Getting hit by the blocks will reset the pickup count and restart the game.
